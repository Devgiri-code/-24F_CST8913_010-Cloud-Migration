 Cloud Migration Lab - A Comparative Study of PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS

**Overview**

This repository contains the deliverables for the Cloud Migration Lab, which explores transitioning a 
traditional on-premises architecture to a cloud-based infrastructure using PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS solutions. 
The focus is on understanding different cloud offerings and developing strategies for migrating from an on-premises setup to the cloud.

**Lab Objectives**

1. Design the current on-premises architecture of a mid-sized retail company.
2. Propose migration strategies for each component using appropriate cloud services (PaaS, IaaS, SaaS).
3. Develop a migration plan outlining each component's steps and considerations.
4. Present the final deliverables in a structured GitHub repository.

 Migration Focus

This lab highlights migration strategies for the following components:
1. **Web Application**: Migrating from physical servers to cloud-based PaaS or IaaS.
2. **SQL Server Database**: Migrating to cloud-based managed services like Azure SQL or Amazon RDS.
3. **File Storage**: Transitioning to scalable cloud-based storage like Azure Blob or AWS S3.
4. **Networking**: Adopting cloud-native networking solutions for secure and scalable infrastructure.
5. **Email Services**: Moving to SaaS-based email solutions for easy management and scalability.
