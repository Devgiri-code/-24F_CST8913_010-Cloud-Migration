      Case Study:  Unity Cloud Migration Overview:

Unity Technologies is a major platform for real-time 3D content production, best known for its popular Unity Engine, which enables developers to create 2D, 3D, VR, and AR apps and games. With extensive documentation, a large user base, and a sophisticated development environment, Unity sought a way to make the game creation process easier for users.

Migration Plan for Unity
________________________________________

1. Motivators for Migration to the Cloud:
•	Scalability: Unity needed a cloud infrastructure that could scale with its growing user base, which includes small indie developers as well as large studios.
•	Speed: Game development requires rapid iteration, and cloud resources help speed up development and problem-solving by providing quick access to resources.
•	AI Integration: Unity wanted to enhance its platform by integrating AI tools (e.g., Muse Chat), which required robust cloud-based AI services to manage large volumes of data and provide real-time assistance to developers.
•	Collaboration & Security: The cloud offered a platform where Unity could securely store, manage, and update its tools while providing worldwide access to its developers.

2. Questions to Understand the Infrastructure:
•	What is the current on-premises infrastructure setup?
•	What are the primary applications and workloads that need to be migrated?
•	What are the data privacy and security requirements specific to the company?
•	How many users and developers access the system, and from which geographies?
•	What current bottlenecks or pain points exist with the on-premises system?
•	What are the peak load times, and how often do they occur?

3. Roles and Responsibilities for Migration Stakeholders:
•	Migration Strategy: The Cloud Architect will develop the migration plan, with the CIO overseeing its alignment with company goals. The IT team and Cloud Vendor provide technical input, while the Executive Team stays informed.
•	Infrastructure Assessment: The IT team is responsible for evaluating the current setup, while the CTO ensures all systems are properly reviewed. The Cloud Architect and Development Teams will stay involved to ensure requirements are met.
•	Security Planning: The Security Team will plan and implement security measures, and the CISO ensures compliance. The IT team supports integration, and leadership is kept in the loop on progress.
•	Data Migration: The IT Team will handle the data transfer, overseen by the Project Manager. The Cloud Vendor assists, and Development Teams are informed throughout the process.
•	Testing: The QA Team tests the new environment, with the QA Lead ensuring everything works smoothly. Development Teams provide feedback, and Stakeholders are updated.
•	Post-Migration Support: IT Support will manage any issues, with the IT Manager responsible for swift resolutions. Cloud Vendor assistance and updates for Development Teams will continue.

5. Migration Timeline:
•	Weeks 1-2: Review infrastructure and finalize the strategy.
•	Weeks 3-4: Design and implement hybrid cloud architecture.
•	Weeks 5-6: Migrate non-sensitive workloads to the cloud.
•	Weeks 7-8: Apply security measures and ensure compliance.
•	Week 9: Conduct system testing.
•	Week 10: Launch cloud services and provide support.
